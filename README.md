## Features

### Navigation

- Featured at the top of the page on the left of the navigation bar is the logo. It links to the home page when clicked.

- The other navigation links are to the right. They change color when the user hovers over them to alert the user that they are interactive.

- The font is coloured similar to the brass of a saxophone with a background color that was taken from the shoes of a model in the main image. 

- The navigation area clearly shows the logo so the user knows that they are in the right place. The other links are clear and their function is easy to understand for a first time user.

- When the screen size is reduced to mobile size, a hamburger menu replaces the existing nav bar. The logo remains in it's position. This feature creates a clean interface on mobile. Without it, the nav bar could take up too much precious real estate and looked cluttered on smaller devices.

### Hero Image

- The hero image was selected for it's pleasing mix of colors that could help to keep the pallette consistent across the site. It feautures a saxophonist in the throes of a solo. The user can be sure that they have arrived at the right site.
